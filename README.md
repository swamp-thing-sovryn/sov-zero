# Zero: Decentralized Borrowing Protocol

![Tests](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/zero/actions/workflows/test-contracts.yml/badge.svg)

Zero is a decentralized protocol based on [Liquity](https://github.com/liquity/dev) that allows Bitcoin holders to obtain maximum liquidity against
their collateral without paying interest. After locking up rBTC as collateral in a smart contract and
creating an individual position called a "line of credit (trove)", the user can get instant liquidity by minting ZSUSD,
a USD-pegged stablecoin. Each line of credit  is required to be collateralized at a minimum of 110%. Any
owner of ZSUSD can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying collateral at any time. The redemption
mechanism along with algorithmically adjusted fees guarantee a minimum stablecoin value of USD 1.

An unprecedented liquidation mechanism based on incentivized stability deposits and a redistribution
cycle from riskier to safer lines of credit provides stability at a much lower collateral ratio than current
systems. Stability is maintained via economically-driven user interactions and arbitrage, rather
than by active governance or monetary interventions.

The protocol has built-in incentives that encourage both early adoption and the operation of
multiple front ends, enhancing decentralization.

## Zero Overview

Zero is a collateralized debt platform. Users can lock up BTC (rBTC), and issue stablecoin tokens (ZSUSD) to their own RSK address, and subsequently transfer those tokens to any other RSK address. The individual collateralized debt positions are called Lines of Credit (Troves).

The stablecoin tokens are economically geared towards maintaining value of 1 ZSUSD = \$1 USD, due to the following properties:

1. The system is designed to always be over-collateralized - the dollar value of the locked rBTC exceeds the dollar value of the issued stablecoins

2. The stablecoins are fully redeemable - users can always swap $x worth of ZSUSD for $x worth of rBTC (minus fees), directly with the system.

3. The system algorithmically controls the generation of ZSUSD through a variable issuance fee.

After opening a line of credit with some rBTC, users may issue ("borrow") tokens such that the collateralization ratio of their line of credit remains above 110%. A user with $1000 worth of rBTC in a line of credit can issue up to 909.09 ZSUSD.

The tokens are freely exchangeable - anyone with an rBTC address can send or receive ZSUSD tokens, whether they have an open line of credit or not. The tokens are burned upon repayment of a line of credit 's debt.

The Zero system regularly updates the rBTC:USD price via a decentralized data feed. When a line of credit  falls below a minimum collateralization ratio (MCR) of 110%, it is considered under-collateralized, and is vulnerable to liquidation.

## Liquidation and the Stability Pool

Zero utilizes a two-step liquidation mechanism in the following order of priority: 

1. Offset under-collateralized lines of credit against the Stability Pool containing ZSUSD tokens

2. Redistribute under-collateralized lines of credit to other borrowers if the Stability Pool is emptied

Zero primarily uses the ZSUSD tokens in its Stability Pool to absorb the under-collateralized debt, i.e. to repay the liquidated borrower's liability.

Any user may deposit ZSUSD tokens to the Stability Pool. This allows them to earn the collateral from the liquidated line of credit . When a liquidation occurs, the liquidated debt is cancelled with the same amount of ZSUSD in the Pool (which is burned as a result), and the liquidated rBTC is proportionally distributed to depositors.

Stability Pool depositors can expect to earn net gains from liquidations, as in most cases, the value of the liquidated rBTC will be greater than the value of the cancelled debt (since a liquidated line of credit will likely have an ICR just slightly below 110%).

If the liquidated debt is higher than the amount of ZSUSD in the Stability Pool, the system tries to cancel as much debt as possible with the tokens in the Stability Pool, and then redistributes the remaining liquidated collateral and debt across all active line of credit s.

Anyone may call the public `liquidateTroves()` function, which will check for under-collateralized line of credit s, and liquidate them. Alternatively they can call `batchLiquidateTroves()` with a custom list of line of credit  addresses to attempt to liquidate.

### Liquidation gas costs

Currently, mass liquidations performed via the above functions cost 60-65k gas per line of credit . Thus the system can liquidate up to a maximum of 95-105 lines of credit in a single transaction.

### Liquidation Logic

The precise behavior of liquidations depends on the ICR of the line of credit  being liquidated and global system conditions:  the total collateralization ratio (TCR) of the system, the size of the Stability Pool, etc.  

Here is the liquidation logic for a single line of credit  in Normal Mode and Recovery Mode.  `SP.ZSUSD` represents the ZSUSD in the Stability Pool.

#### Liquidations in Normal Mode: TCR >= 150%

## Gains From Liquidations

Stability Pool depositors gain rBTC over time, as liquidated debt is cancelled with their deposit. When they withdraw all or part of their deposited tokens, or top up their deposit, the system sends them their accumulated rBTC gains.

Similarly, a line of credit 's accumulated gains from liquidations are automatically applied to the line of credit  when the owner performs any operation - e.g. adding/withdrawing collateral, or issuing/repaying ZSUSD.

## ZSUSD Token Redemption

Any ZSUSD holder (whether or not they have an active line of credit) may redeem their ZSUSD directly with the system. Their ZSUSD is exchanged for rBTC, at face value: redeeming x ZSUSD tokens returns \$x worth of rBTC (minus a [redemption fee](#redemption-fee)).

When ZSUSD is redeemed for rBTC, the system cancels the ZSUSD with debt from line of credit s, and the rBTC is drawn from their collateral.

In order to fulfill the redemption request, lines of credit are redeemed from in ascending order of their collateralization ratio.

A redemption sequence of `n` steps will **fully** redeem from up to `n-1` line of credit s, and, and **partially** redeems from up to 1 line of credit , which is always the last line of credit  in the redemption sequence.

Redemptions are blocked when TCR < 110% (there is no need to restrict ICR < TCR). At that TCR redemptions would likely be unprofitable, as ZSUSD is probably trading above $1 if the system has crashed that badly, but it could be a way for an attacker with a lot of ZSUSD to lower the TCR even further.

Note that redemptions are disabled during the first 14 days of operation since deployment of the Zero protocol to protect the monetary system in its infancy.

### Partial redemption

Most redemption transactions will include a partial redemption, since the amount redeemed is unlikely to perfectly match the total debt of a series of line of credit s.

The partially redeemed line of credit  is re-inserted into the sorted list of line of credit s, and remains active, with reduced collateral and debt.

### Full redemption

A line of credit  is defined as “fully redeemed from” when the redemption has caused (debt-200) of its debt to absorb (debt-200) ZSUSD. Then, its 200 ZSUSD Liquidation Reserve is cancelled with its remaining 200 debt: the Liquidation Reserve is burned from the gas address, and the 200 debt is zero’d.

Before closing, we must handle the line of credit ’s **collateral surplus**: that is, the excess rBTC collateral remaining after redemption, due to its initial over-collateralization.

This collateral surplus is sent to the `CollSurplusPool`, and the borrower can reclaim it later. The line of credit  is then fully closed.

### Redemptions create a price floor

Economically, the redemption mechanism creates a hard price floor for ZSUSD, ensuring that the market price stays at or near to $1 USD. 

## Recovery Mode

Recovery Mode kicks in when the total collateralization ratio (TCR) of the system falls below 150%.

During Recovery Mode, liquidation conditions are relaxed, and the system blocks borrower transactions that would further decrease the TCR. New ZSUSD may only be issued by adjusting existing lines of credit in a way that improves their ICR, or by opening a new line of credit  with an ICR of >=150%. In general, if an existing line of credit 's adjustment reduces its ICR, the transaction is only executed if the resulting TCR is above 150%

Recovery Mode is structured to incentivize borrowers to behave in ways that promptly raise the TCR back above 150%, and to incentivize ZSUSD holders to replenish the Stability Pool.

Economically, Recovery Mode is designed to encourage collateral top-ups and debt repayments, and also itself acts as a self-negating deterrent: the possibility of it occurring actually guides the system away from ever reaching it.

### Branches

As of 18/01/2021, the current working branch is `main`. `master` is out of date.

## ZERO Token Architecture

The Zero system incorporates a secondary token, ZERO. This token entitles the holder to a share of the system revenue generated by redemption fees and  issuance fees.

To earn a share of system fees, the ZERO holder must stake their ZERO in a staking contract.

Zero also issues ZERO to Stability Providers, in a continous time-based manner.

The ZERO contracts consist of:

`ZEROStaking.sol` - the staking contract, containing stake and unstake functionality for ZERO holders. This contract receives rBTC fees from redemptions, and ZSUSD fees from new debt issuance.

`CommunityIssuance.sol` - This contract handles the issuance of ZERO tokens to Stability Providers as a function of time. It is controlled by the `StabilityPool`. Upon system launch, the `CommunityIssuance` automatically receives 30 million ZERO - the “community issuance” supply. The contract steadily issues these ZERO tokens to the Stability Providers over time.

`ZEROToken.sol` - This is the ZERO ERC20 contract. It has a hard cap supply of 100 million, and during the first year, restricts transfers from the Zero admin address, a regular RSK address controlled by the project company Zero AG. **Note that the Zero admin address has no extra privileges and does not retain any control over the Zero protocol once deployed.**

### ZERO Lockup contracts and token vesting

Some ZERO is reserved for team members and partners, and is locked up for one year upon system launch. Additionally, some team members receive ZERO vested on a monthly basis, which during the first year, is transferred directly to their lockup contract.

In the first year after launch:

- All team members and partners are unable to access their locked up ZERO tokens

- The Zero admin address may transfer tokens **only to verified lockup contracts with an unlock date at least one year after system deployment**

Also, separate ZERO allocations are made at deployent to an EOA that will hold an amount of ZERO for bug bounties/hackathons and to a Uniswap LP reward contract. Aside from these allocations, the only ZERO made freely available in this first year is the ZERO that is publicly issued to Stability Providers via the `CommunityIssuance` contract.

### Lockup Implementation and admin transfer restriction

A `LockupContractFactory` is used to deploy `LockupContracts` in the first year. During the first year, the `ZEROToken` checks that any transfer from the Zero admin address is to a valid `LockupContract` that is registered in and was deployed through the `LockupContractFactory`.

### Launch sequence and vesting process

#### Deploy ZERO Contracts
1. Zero admin deploys `LockupContractFactory`
2. Zero admin deploys `CommunityIssuance` and `SovStakersIssuance`
3. Zero admin deploys `ZEROStaking` 
4. Zero admin deploys `ZEROToken`, which upon deployment:
- Stores the `CommunityIssuance`, `SovStakersIssuance`, Sovryn's Liquidity Mining and `LockupContractFactory` addresses
- Mints ZERO tokens to `CommunityIssuance`, `SovStakersIssuance`, the Zero admin address and the Liquidity Mining contract.
1. Zero admin sets `ZEROToken` address in `LockupContractFactory`, `CommunityIssuance`, `SovStakersIssuance`

#### Deploy and fund Lockup Contracts
6. Zero admin tells `LockupContractFactory` to deploy a `LockupContract` for each beneficiary, with an `unlockTime` set to exactly one year after system deployment
7. Zero admin transfers ZERO to each `LockupContract`, according to their entitlement

#### Deploy Zero Core
8. Zero admin deploys the Zero core system
9. Zero admin connects Zero core system internally (with setters)
10. Zero admin connects `ZEROStaking` to Zero core contracts and `ZEROToken`
11. Zero admin connects `CommunityIssuance` and `SovStakersIssuance` to Zero core contracts and `ZEROToken`

#### During one year lockup period
- Zero admin periodically transfers newly vested tokens to team & partners’ `LockupContracts`, as per their vesting schedules
- Zero admin may only transfer ZERO to `LockupContracts`
- Anyone may deploy new `LockupContracts` via the Factory, setting any `unlockTime` that is >= 1 year from system deployment

#### Upon end of one year lockup period
- All beneficiaries may withdraw their entire entitlements
- Zero admin address restriction on ZERO transfers is automatically lifted, and Zero admin may now transfer ZERO to any address
- Anyone may deploy new `LockupContracts` via the Factory, setting any `unlockTime` in the future

#### Post-lockup period
- Zero admin periodically transfers newly vested tokens to team & partners, directly to their individual addresses, or to a fresh lockup contract if required.

_NOTE: In the final architecture, a multi-sig contract will be used to move ZERO Tokens, rather than the single Zero admin EOA. It will be deployed at the start of the sequence, and have its address recorded in  `ZEROToken` in step 4, and receive ZERO tokens. It will be used to move ZERO in step 7, and during & after the lockup period. The Zero admin EOA will only be used for deployment of contracts in steps 1-4 and 9._

_The current code does not utilize a multi-sig. It implements the launch architecture outlined above._

_Additionally, a LP staking contract will receive the initial LP staking reward allowance, rather than an EOA. It will be used to hold and issue ZERO to users who stake LP tokens that correspond to certain pools on DEXs._

## Core System Architecture

The core Zero system consists of several smart contracts, which are deployable to the RSK blockchain.

All application logic and data is contained in these contracts - there is no need for a separate database or back end logic running on a web server. In effect, the RSK network is itself the Zero back end. As such, all balances and contract data are public.

The system ownership is granted to the [TimeLock](https://github.com/DistributedCollective/Sovryn-smart-contracts/blob/development/contracts/governance/Timelock.sol) contract so the system could be upgraded by the Sovryn's governance system.

The three main contracts - `BorrowerOperations.sol`, `TroveManager.sol` and `StabilityPool.sol` - hold the user-facing public functions, and contain most of the internal system logic. TogrBTC they control line of credit  state updates and movements of rBTC and ZSUSD tokens around the system.

### Core Smart Contracts

`BorrowerOperations.sol` - contains the basic operations by which borrowers interact with their line of credit : line of credit  creation, rBTC top-up / withdrawal, stablecoin issuance and repayment. It also sends issuance fees to the `ZEROStaking` contract. BorrowerOperations functions call in to line of credit Manager, telling it to update line of credit  state, where necessary. BorrowerOperations functions also call in to the various Pools, telling them to move rBTC/Tokens between Pools or between Pool <> user, where necessary.

`TroveManager.sol` - contains functionality for liquidations and redemptions. It sends redemption fees to the `ZEROStaking` contract. Also contains the state of each line of credit  - i.e. a record of the line of credit ’s collateral and debt. line of credit Manager does not hold value (i.e. rBTC / other tokens). line of credit Manager functions call in to the various Pools to tell them to move rBTC/tokens between Pools, where necessary.

`LiquityBase.sol` - Both line of credit Manager and BorrowerOperations inherit from the parent contract LiquityBase, which contains global constants and some common functions.

`StabilityPool.sol` - contains functionality for Stability Pool operations: making deposits, and withdrawing compounded deposits and accumulated rBTC and ZERO gains. Holds the ZSUSD Stability Pool deposits, and the rBTC gains for depositors, from liquidations.

`ZSUSDToken.sol` - the stablecoin token contract, which implements the ERC20 fungible token standard in conjunction with EIP-2612 and a mechanism that blocks (accidental) transfers to addresses like the StabilityPool and address(0) that are not supposed to receive funds through direct transfers. The contract mints, burns and transfers ZSUSD tokens.

`SortedTroves.sol` - a doubly linked list that stores addresses of line of credit  owners, sorted by their individual collateralization ratio (ICR). It inserts and re-inserts lines of credit at the correct position, based on their ICR.

`PriceFeed.sol` - Contains functionality for obtaining the current rBTC:USD price, which the system uses for calculating collateralization ratios.

`HintHelpers.sol` - Helper contract, containing the read-only functionality for calculation of accurate hints to be supplied to borrower operations and redemptions.

### Data and Value Silo Contracts

Along with `StabilityPool.sol`, these contracts hold rBTC and/or tokens for their respective parts of the system, and contain minimal logic:

`ActivePool.sol` - holds the total rBTC balance and records the total stablecoin debt of the active line of credit s.

`DefaultPool.sol` - holds the total rBTC balance and records the total stablecoin debt of the liquidated lines of credit that are pending redistribution to active line of credit s. If a line of credit  has pending rBTC/debt “rewards” in the DefaultPool, then they will be applied to the line of credit  when it next undergoes a borrower operation, a redemption, or a liquidation.

`CollSurplusPool.sol` - holds the rBTC surplus from lines of credit that have been fully redeemed from as well as from lines of credit with an ICR > MCR that were liquidated in Recovery Mode. Sends the surplus back to the owning borrower, when told to do so by `BorrowerOperations.sol`.

`GasPool.sol` - holds the total ZSUSD liquidation reserves. ZSUSD is moved into the `GasPool` when a line of credit  is opened, and moved out when a line of credit  is liquidated or closed.

### Contract Interfaces

`ITroveManager.sol`, `IPool.sol` etc. These provide specification for a contract’s functions, without implementation. They are similar to interfaces in Java or C#.

### PriceFeed and Oracle

Zero functions that require the most current rBTC:USD price data fetch the price dynamically, as needed, via the core `PriceFeed.sol` contract using the MoC Medianizer rBTC:USD reference contract as its primary and RSK's rBTC:USD price feed as its secondary (fallback) data source. PriceFeed is stateful, i.e. it records the last good price that may come from either of the two sources based on the contract's current state.

The current `PriceFeed.sol` contract has an external `fetchPrice()` function that is called by core Zero functions which require a current rBTC:USD price.  `fetchPrice()` calls each oracle's proxy, asserts on the responses, and converts returned prices to 18 digits.

### PriceFeed Logic

The PriceFeed contract uses the main price feed and fallback to the backup one in case of an error. If both fail return the last good price seen.

### Testnet PriceFeed and PriceFeed tests

The `PriceFeedTestnet.sol` is a mock PriceFeed for testnet and general back end testing purposes, with no oracle connection. It contains a manual price setter, `setPrice()`, and a getter, `getPrice()`, which returns the latest stored price.

The mainnet PriceFeed is tested in `test/PriceFeedTest.js`, using `ExternalPriceFeedTester` contract as mocks for primary and secondary price feeds.

### PriceFeed limitations and known issues

The purpose of the PriceFeed is to have some resilience in case of MoC Medianizer failure / timeout, and chance of recovery.

The PriceFeed logic consists of automatic on-chain decision-making for obtaining fallback price data from RSK Oracle, and if possible, for returning to MoC Medianizer if/when it recovers.

### Keeping a sorted list of lines of credit ordered by ICR

Zero relies on a particular data structure: a sorted doubly-linked list of lines of credit that remains ordered by individual collateralization ratio (ICR), i.e. the amount of collateral (in USD) divided by the amount of debt (in ZSUSD).

This ordered list is critical for gas-efficient redemption sequences and for the `liquidateTroves` sequence, both of which target lines of credit in ascending order of ICR.

The sorted doubly-linked list is found in `SortedTroves.sol`. 

Nodes map to active lines of credit in the system - the ID property is the address of a line of credit  owner. The list accepts positional hints for efficient O(1) insertion - please see the [hints](#supplying-hints-to-cdp-operations) section for more details.

ICRs are computed dynamically at runtime, and not stored on the node. This is because ICRs of active lines of credit change dynamically, when:

- The rBTC:USD price varies, altering the USD of the collateral of every line of credit 
- A liquidation that redistributes collateral and debt to active lines of credit occurs

The list relies on the fact that a collateral and debt redistribution due to a liquidation preserves the ordering of all active lines of credit (though it does decrease the ICR of each active line of credit  above the MCR).

The fact that ordering is maintained as redistributions occur, is not immediately obvious: please see the [mathematical proof](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/papers) which shows that this holds in Liquity.

A node inserted based on current ICR will maintain the correct position, relative to its peers, as liquidation gains accumulate, as long as its raw collateral and debt have not changed.

Nodes also remain sorted as the rBTC:USD price varies, since price fluctuations change the collateral value of each line of credit  by the same proportion.

Thus, nodes need only be re-inserted to the sorted list upon a line of credit  operation - when the owner adds or removes collateral or debt to their position.

### Flow of rBTC in Liquity

![Flow of rBTC](images/rBTC_flows.svg)

rBTC in the system lives in three Pools: the ActivePool, the DefaultPool and the StabilityPool. When an operation is made, rBTC is transferred in one of three ways:

- From a user to a Pool
- From a Pool to a user
- From one Pool to another Pool

rBTC is recorded on an _individual_ level, but stored in _aggregate_ in a Pool. An active line of credit  with collateral and debt has a struct in the line of credit Manager that stores its rBTC collateral value in a uint, but its actual rBTC is in the balance of the ActivePool contract.

Likewise, the StabilityPool holds the total accumulated rBTC gains from liquidations for all depositors.

### Flow of ZSUSD tokens in Liquity

![Flow of ZSUSD](images/ZSUSD_flows.svg)

When a user issues debt from their line of credit , ZSUSD tokens are minted to their own address, and a debt is recorded on the line of credit . Conversely, when they repay their line of credit ’s ZSUSD debt, ZSUSD is burned from their address, and the debt on their line of credit  is reduced.

Redemptions burn ZSUSD from the redeemer’s balance, and reduce the debt of the line of credit  redeemed against.

Liquidations that involve a Stability Pool offset burn tokens from the Stability Pool’s balance, and reduce the ZSUSD debt of the liquidated line of credit .

The only time ZSUSD is transferred to/from a Zero contract, is when a user deposits ZSUSD to, or withdraws ZSUSD from, the StabilityPool.

### Flow of ZERO Tokens in Liquity

![Flow of ZERO](images/ZERO_flows.svg)

Stability Providers and Frontend Operators receive ZERO gains according to their share of the total ZSUSD deposits, and the ZERO community issuance schedule.  Once obtained, ZERO can be staked and unstaked with the `ZEROStaking` contract.

**Stability Pool**

| unstake  | staker's ZERO withdrawal       | ZERO._transfer(ZEROStakingAddress, msg.sender, _amount); |


## Expected User Behaviors

Generally, borrowers call functions that trigger line of credit  operations on their own line of credit . Stability Pool users (who may or may not also be borrowers) call functions that trigger Stability Pool operations, such as depositing or withdrawing tokens to/from the Stability Pool.

Anyone may call the public liquidation functions, and attempt to liquidate one or several line of credit s.

ZSUSD token holders may also redeem their tokens, and swap an amount of tokens 1-for-1 in value (minus fees) with rBTC.

ZERO token holders may stake their ZERO, to earn a share of the system fee revenue, in rBTC and ZSUSD.

## Contract Ownership and Function Permissions

All the core smart contracts inherit from the OpenZeppelin `Ownable.sol` contract template. As such all contracts have a single owning address, which is the deploying address. The contract's ownership is trasnferred to the Sovryn's governance system thorough it's TimeLock contract.

Several public and external functions have modifiers such as `requireCallerIsTroveManager`, `requireCallerIsActivePool`, etc - ensuring they can only be called by the respective permitted contract.

## Deployment to a Development Blockchain

The Hardhat migrations script and deployment helpers in `utils/deploymentHelpers.js` deploy all contracts, and connect all contracts to their dependency contracts, by setting the necessary deployed addresses.

The project is deployed on the Ropsten testnet.

## Running Tests

Run all tests with `npx hardhat test`, or run a specific test with `npx hardhat test ./test/contractTest.js`

Tests are run against the Hardhat EVM.

**⚠ This tests are not working and might not be supported due to the fact they require some accounts to be preloaded in a specific way and RSK node does not support it out of the box. This tests exercise the system in a way that's already covered by the JS tests.**

There are some special tests that are using Brownie framework.

To test, install brownie with:
```
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

pipx install eth-brownie
```

and add numpy with:
```
pipx inject eth-brownie numpy
```

Add OpenZeppelin package:
```
brownie pm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@3.3.0
```

Run, from `packages/contracts/`:
```
brownie test -s
```

### RSK Regtest node

Add the local node as a `live` network at `~/.brownie/network-config.yaml`:
```
(...)
      - name: Local RSK
        chainid: 31
        id: rsk-testnet
        host: http://localhost:4444
```

Make sure state is cleaned up first:
```
rm -Rf build/deployments/*
```

Start RSK node from this repo’s root with:
```
yarn start-dev-chain:rsk
```

Then, again from `packages/contracts/`, run it with:
```
brownie test -s --network rsk-testnet
```

To stop the RSK node, you can do it with:
```
yarn stop-dev-chain
```

## System Quantities - Units and Representation

### Integer representations of decimals

Several ratios and the rBTC:USD price are integer representations of decimals, to 18 digits of precision. For example:

| **uint representation of decimal** | **Number**    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1100000000000000000                | 1.1           |
| 200000000000000000000              | 200           |
| 1000000000000000000                | 1             |
| 5432100000000000000                | 5.4321        |

## Public User-Facing Functions

### Borrower (Trove) Operations - `BorrowerOperations.sol`

`openTrove(uint _maxFeePercentage, uint _ZSUSDAmount, address _upperHint, address _lowerHint)`: payable function that creates a line of credit  for the caller with the requested debt, and the rBTC received as collateral. Successful execution is conditional mainly on the resulting collateralization ratio which must exceed the minimum (110% in Normal Mode, 150% in Recovery Mode). In addition to the requested debt, extra debt is issued to pay the issuance fee, and cover the gas compensation. The borrower has to provide a `_maxFeePercentage` that he/she is willing to accept in case of a fee slippage, i.e. when a redemption transaction is processed first, driving up the issuance fee. 

`addColl(address _upperHint, address _lowerHint))`: payable function that adds the received rBTC to the caller's active line of credit .

`withdrawColl(uint _amount, address _upperHint, address _lowerHint)`: withdraws `_amount` of collateral from the caller’s line of credit . Executes only if the user has an active line of credit , the withdrawal would not pull the user’s line of credit  below the minimum collateralization ratio, and the resulting total collateralization ratio of the system is above 150%. 

`function withdrawZSUSD(uint _maxFeePercentage, uint _ZSUSDAmount, address _upperHint, address _lowerHint)`: issues `_amount` of ZSUSD from the caller’s line of credit  to the caller. Executes only if the line of credit 's collateralization ratio would remain above the minimum, and the resulting total collateralization ratio is above 150%. The borrower has to provide a `_maxFeePercentage` that he/she is willing to accept in case of a fee slippage, i.e. when a redemption transaction is processed first, driving up the issuance fee.

`repayZSUSD(uint _amount, address _upperHint, address _lowerHint)`: repay `_amount` of ZSUSD to the caller’s line of credit , subject to leaving 20 debt in the line of credit  (which corresponds to the 20 ZSUSD gas compensation).

`_adjustTrove(address _borrower, uint _collWithdrawal, uint _debtChange, bool _isDebtIncrease, address _upperHint, address _lowerHint, uint _maxFeePercentage)`: enables a borrower to simultaneously change both their collateral and debt, subject to all the restrictions that apply to individual increases/decreases of each quantity with the following particularity: if the adjustment reduces the collateralization ratio of the line of credit , the function only executes if the resulting total collateralization ratio is above 150%. The borrower has to provide a `_maxFeePercentage` that he/she is willing to accept in case of a fee slippage, i.e. when a redemption transaction is processed first, driving up the issuance fee. The parameter is ignored if the debt is not increased with the transaction.

`closeTrove()`: allows a borrower to repay all debt, withdraw all their collateral, and close their line of credit . Requires the borrower have a ZSUSD balance sufficient to repay their line of credit 's debt, excluding gas compensation - i.e. `(debt - 50)` ZSUSD.

`claimCollateral(address _user)`: when a borrower’s line of credit  has been fully redeemed from and closed, or liquidated in Recovery Mode with a collateralization ratio above 110%, this function allows the borrower to claim their rBTC collateral surplus that remains in the system (collateral - debt upon redemption; collateral - 110% of the debt upon liquidation).

### line of credit Manager Functions - `TroveManager.sol`

`liquidate(address _borrower)`: callable by anyone, attempts to liquidate the line of credit  of `_user`. Executes successfully if `_user`’s line of credit  meets the conditions for liquidation (e.g. in Normal Mode, it liquidates if the line of credit 's ICR < the system MCR).  

`liquidateTroves(uint n)`: callable by anyone, checks for under-collateralized lines of credit below MCR and liquidates up to `n`, starting from the line of credit  with the lowest collateralization ratio; subject to gas constraints and the actual number of under-collateralized line of credit s. The gas costs of `liquidateTroves(uint n)` mainly depend on the number of lines of credit that are liquidated, and whether the lines of credit are offset against the Stability Pool or redistributed. For n=1, the gas costs per liquidated line of credit  are roughly between 215K-400K, for n=5 between 80K-115K, for n=10 between 70K-82K, and for n=50 between 60K-65K.

`batchLiquidateTroves(address[] calldata _troveArray)`: callable by anyone, accepts a custom list of lines of credit addresses as an argument. Steps through the provided list and attempts to liquidate every line of credit , until it reaches the end or it runs out of gas. A line of credit  is liquidated only if it meets the conditions for liquidation. For a batch of 10 line of credit s, the gas costs per liquidated line of credit  are roughly between 75K-83K, for a batch of 50 lines of credit between 54K-69K.

`redeemCollateral(uint _ZSUSDAmount, address _firstRedemptionHint, address _upperPartialRedemptionHint, address _lowerPartialRedemptionHint, uint _partialRedemptionHintNICR, uint _maxIterations, uint _maxFeePercentage)`: redeems `_ZSUSDamount` of stablecoins for rBTC from the system. Decreases the caller’s ZSUSD balance, and sends them the corresponding amount of rBTC. Executes successfully if the caller has sufficient ZSUSD to redeem. The number of lines of credit redeemed from is capped by `_maxIterations`. The borrower has to provide a `_maxFeePercentage` that he/she is willing to accept in case of a fee slippage, i.e. when another redemption transaction is processed first, driving up the redemption fee.

`getCurrentICR(address _user, uint _price)`: computes the user’s individual collateralization ratio (ICR) based on their total collateral and total ZSUSD debt. Returns 2^256 -1 if they have 0 debt.

`getTroveOwnersCount()`: get the number of active lines of credit in the system.

`getPendingrBTCReward(address _borrower)`: get the pending rBTC reward from liquidation redistribution events, for the given line of credit .

`getPendingZSUSDDebtReward(address _borrower)`: get the pending line of credit  debt "reward" (i.e. the amount of extra debt assigned to the line of credit ) from liquidation redistribution events.

`getEntireDebtAndColl(address _borrower)`: returns a line of credit ’s entire debt and collateral, which respectively include any pending debt rewards and rBTC rewards from prior redistributions.

`getEntireSystemColl()`:  Returns the systemic entire collateral allocated to line of credit s, i.e. the sum of the rBTC in the Active Pool and the Default Pool.

`getEntireSystemDebt()` Returns the systemic entire debt assigned to line of credit s, i.e. the sum of the ZSUSDDebt in the Active Pool and the Default Pool.

`getTCR()`: returns the total collateralization ratio (TCR) of the system.  The TCR is based on the the entire system debt and collateral (including pending rewards).

`checkRecoveryMode()`: reveals whether or not the system is in Recovery Mode (i.e. whether the Total Collateralization Ratio (TCR) is below the Critical Collateralization Ratio (CCR)).

### Hint Helper Functions - `HintHelpers.sol`

`function getApproxHint(uint _CR, uint _numTrials, uint _inputRandomSeed)`: helper function, returns a positional hint for the sorted list. Used for transactions that must efficiently re-insert a line of credit  to the sorted list.

`getRedemptionHints(uint _ZSUSDamount, uint _price, uint _maxIterations)`: helper function specifically for redemptions. Returns three hints:

- `firstRedemptionHint` is a positional hint for the first redeemable line of credit  (i.e. line of credit  with the lowest ICR >= MCR).
- `partialRedemptionHintNICR` is the final nominal ICR of the last line of credit  after being hit by partial redemption, or zero in case of no partial redemption (see [Hints for `redeemCollateral`](#hints-for-redeemcollateral)).
- `truncatedZSUSDamount` is the maximum amount that can be redeemed out of the the provided `_ZSUSDamount`. This can be lower than `_ZSUSDamount` when redeeming the full amount would leave the last line of credit  of the redemption sequence with less debt than the minimum allowed value.

The number of lines of credit to consider for redemption can be capped by passing a non-zero value as `_maxIterations`, while passing zero will leave it uncapped.

### Stability Pool Functions - `StabilityPool.sol`

`provideToSP(uint _amount, address _frontEndTag)`: allows stablecoin holders to deposit `_amount` of ZSUSD to the Stability Pool. It sends `_amount` of ZSUSD from their address to the Pool, and tops up their ZSUSD deposit by `_amount` and their tagged front end’s stake by `_amount`. If the depositor already has a non-zero deposit, it sends their accumulated rBTC and ZERO gains to their address, and pays out their front end’s ZERO gain to their front end.

`withdrawFromSP(uint _amount)`: allows a stablecoin holder to withdraw `_amount` of ZSUSD from the Stability Pool, up to the value of their remaining Stability deposit. It decreases their ZSUSD balance by `_amount` and decreases their front end’s stake by `_amount`. It sends the depositor’s accumulated rBTC and ZERO gains to their address, and pays out their front end’s ZERO gain to their front end. If the user makes a partial withdrawal, their deposit remainder will earn further gains. To prevent potential loss evasion by depositors, withdrawals from the Stability Pool are suspended when there are liquidable lines of credit with ICR < 110% in the system.

`withdrawrBTCGainToTrove(address _hint)`: sends the user's entire accumulated rBTC gain to the user's active line of credit , and updates their Stability deposit with its accumulated loss from debt absorptions. Sends the depositor's ZERO gain to the depositor, and sends the tagged front end's ZERO gain to the front end.

`registerFrontEnd(uint _kickbackRate)`: Registers an address as a front end and sets their chosen kickback rate in range `[0,1]`.

`getDepositorrBTCGain(address _depositor)`: returns the accumulated rBTC gain for a given Stability Pool depositor

`getDepositorZEROGain(address _depositor)`: returns the accumulated ZERO gain for a given Stability Pool depositor

`getFrontEndZEROGain(address _frontEnd)`: returns the accumulated ZERO gain for a given front end

`getCompoundedZSUSDDeposit(address _depositor)`: returns the remaining deposit amount for a given Stability Pool depositor

`getCompoundedFrontEndStake(address _frontEnd)`: returns the remaining front end stake for a given front end

### ZERO Staking Functions  `ZEROStaking.sol`

 `stake(uint _ZEROamount)`: sends `_ZEROAmount` from the caller to the staking contract, and increases their stake. If the caller already has a non-zero stake, it pays out their accumulated rBTC and ZSUSD gains from staking.

 `unstake(uint _ZEROamount)`: reduces the caller’s stake by `_ZEROamount`, up to a maximum of their entire stake. It pays out their accumulated rBTC and ZSUSD gains from staking.

### Lockup Contract Factory `LockupContractFactory.sol`

`deployLockupContract(address _beneficiary, uint _unlockTime)`; Deploys a `LockupContract`, and sets the beneficiary’s address, and the `_unlockTime` - the instant in time at which the ZERO can be withrawn by the beneficiary.

### Lockup contract - `LockupContract.sol`

`withdrawZERO()`: When the current time is later than the `unlockTime` and the caller is the beneficiary, it transfers their ZERO to them.

### ZSUSD token `ZSUSDToken.sol` and ZERO token `ZEROToken.sol`

Standard ERC20 and EIP2612 (`permit()` ) functionality.

**Note**: `permit()` can be front-run, as it does not require that the permitted spender be the `msg.sender`.

This allows flexibility, as it means that _anyone_ can submit a Permit signed by A that allows B to spend a portion of A's tokens.

The end result is the same for the signer A and spender B, but does mean that a `permit` transaction
could be front-run and revert - which may hamper the execution flow of a contract that is intended to handle the submission of a Permit on-chain.

## Supplying Hints to line of credit  operations

Troves in Zero are recorded in a sorted doubly linked list, sorted by their NICR, from high to low. NICR stands for the nominal collateral ratio that is simply the amount of collateral (in rBTC) multiplied by 100e18 and divided by the amount of debt (in ZSUSD), without taking the rBTC:USD price into account. Given that all lines of credit are equally affected by rBTC price changes, they do not need to be sorted by their real ICR.

All line of credit  operations that change the collateralization ratio need to either insert or reinsert the line of credit  to the `SortedTroves` list. To reduce the computational complexity (and gas cost) of the insertion to the linked list, two ‘hints’ may be provided.

A hint is the address of a line of credit  with a position in the sorted list close to the correct insert position.

All line of credit  operations take two ‘hint’ arguments: a `_lowerHint` referring to the `nextId` and an `_upperHint` referring to the `prevId` of the two adjacent nodes in the linked list that are (or would become) the neighbors of the given line of credit . Taking both direct neighbors as hints has the advantage of being much more resilient to situations where a neighbor gets moved or removed before the caller's transaction is processed: the transaction would only fail if both neighboring lines of credit are affected during the pendency of the transaction.

The better the ‘hint’ is, the shorter the list traversal, and the cheaper the gas cost of the function call. `SortedList::findInsertPosition(uint256 _NICR, address _prevId, address _nextId)` that is called by the line of credit  operation firsts check if `prevId` is still existant and valid (larger NICR than the provided `_NICR`) and then descends the list starting from `prevId`. If the check fails, the function further checks if `nextId` is still existant and valid (smaller NICR than the provided `_NICR`) and then ascends list starting from `nextId`. 

The `HintHelpers::getApproxHint(...)` function can be used to generate a useful hint pointing to a line of credit  relatively close to the target position, which can then be passed as an argument to the desired line of credit  operation or to `SortedTroves::findInsertPosition(...)` to get its two direct neighbors as ‘exact‘ hints (based on the current state of the system).

`getApproxHint(uint _CR, uint _numTrials, uint _inputRandomSeed)` randomly selects `numTrials` amount of line of credit s, and returns the one with the closest position in the list to where a line of credit  with a nominal collateralization ratio of `_CR` should be inserted. It can be shown mathematically that for `numTrials = k * sqrt(n)`, the function's gas cost is with very high probability worst case `O(sqrt(n)) if k >= 10`. For scalability reasons (Infura is able to serve up to ~4900 trials), the function also takes a random seed `_inputRandomSeed` to make sure that calls with different seeds may lead to a different results, allowing for better approximations through multiple consecutive runs.

**Trove operation without a hint**

1. User performs line of credit  operation in their browser
2. Call the line of credit  operation with `_lowerHint = _upperHint = userAddress`

Gas cost will be worst case `O(n)`, where n is the size of the `SortedTroves` list.

**Trove operation with hints**

1. User performs line of credit  operation in their browser
2. The front end computes a new collateralization ratio locally, based on the change in collateral and/or debt.
3. Call `HintHelpers::getApproxHint(...)`, passing it the computed nominal collateralization ratio. Returns an address close to the correct insert position
4. Call `SortedTroves::findInsertPosition(uint256 _NICR, address _prevId, address _nextId)`, passing it the same approximate hint via both `_prevId` and `_nextId` and the new nominal collateralization ratio via `_NICR`. 
5. Pass the ‘exact‘ hint in the form of the two direct neighbors, i.e. `_nextId` as `_lowerHint` and `_prevId` as `_upperHint`, to the line of credit  operation function call. (Note that the hint may become slightly inexact due to pending transactions that are processed first, though this is gracefully handled by the system that can ascend or descend the list as needed to find the right position.)

Gas cost of steps 2-4 will be free, and step 5 will be `O(1)`.

Hints allow cheaper line of credit  operations for the user, at the expense of a slightly longer time to completion, due to the need to await the result of the two read calls in steps 1 and 2 - which may be sent as JSON-RPC requests to Infura, unless the Frontend Operator is running a full RSK node.

### Example Borrower Operations with Hints

#### Opening a line of credit 
```
  const toWei = web3.utils.toWei
  const toBN = web3.utils.toBN

  const ZSUSDAmount = toBN(toWei('2500')) // borrower wants to withdraw 2500 ZSUSD
  const rBTCColl = toBN(toWei('5')) // borrower wants to lock 5 rBTC collateral

  // Call deployed line of credit Manager contract to read the liquidation reserve and latest borrowing fee
  const liquidationReserve = await line of credit Manager.ZSUSD_GAS_COMPENSATION()
  const expectedFee = await line of credit Manager.getBorrowingFeeWithDecay(ZSUSDAmount)
  
  // Total debt of the new line of credit  = ZSUSD amount drawn, plus fee, plus the liquidation reserve
  const expectedDebt = ZSUSDAmount.add(expectedFee).add(liquidationReserve)

  // Get the nominal NICR of the new line of credit 
  const _1e20 = toBN(toWei('100'))
  let NICR = rBTCColl.mul(_1e20).div(expectedDebt)

  // Get an approximate address hint from the deployed HintHelper contract. Use (15 * number of line of credit s) trials 
  // to get an approx. hint that is close to the right position.
  let numTroves = await sortedTroves.getSize()
  let numTrials = numTroves.mul(toBN('15'))
  let { 0: approxHint } = await hintHelpers.getApproxHint(NICR, numTrials, 42)  // random seed of 42

  // Use the approximate hint to get the exact upper and lower hints from the deployed SortedTroves contract
  let { 0: upperHint, 1: lowerHint } = await sortedTroves.findInsertPosition(NICR, approxHint, approxHint)

  // Finally, call openTrove with the exact upperHint and lowerHint
  const maxFee = '5'.concat('0'.repeat(16)) // Slippage protection: 5%
  await borrowerOperations.openTrove(maxFee, ZSUSDAmount, upperHint, lowerHint, { value: rBTCColl })
```

#### Adjusting a line of credit 
```
  const collIncrease = toBN(toWei('1'))  // borrower wants to add 1 rBTC
  const ZSUSDRepayment = toBN(toWei('230')) // borrower wants to repay 230 ZSUSD

  // Get line of credit 's current debt and coll
  const {0: debt, 1: coll} = await line of credit Manager.getEntireDebtAndColl(borrower)
  
  const newDebt = debt.sub(ZSUSDRepayment)
  const newColl = coll.add(collIncrease)

  NICR = newColl.mul(_1e20).div(newDebt)

  // Get an approximate address hint from the deployed HintHelper contract. Use (15 * number of line of credit s) trials 
  // to get an approx. hint that is close to the right position.
  numTroves = await sortedTroves.getSize()
  numTrials = numTroves.mul(toBN('15'))
  ({0: approxHint} = await hintHelpers.getApproxHint(NICR, numTrials, 42))

  // Use the approximate hint to get the exact upper and lower hints from the deployed SortedTroves contract
  ({ 0: upperHint, 1: lowerHint } = await sortedTroves.findInsertPosition(NICR, approxHint, approxHint))

  // Call adjustTrove with the exact upperHint and lowerHint
  await borrowerOperations.adjustTrove(maxFee, 0, ZSUSDRepayment, false, upperHint, lowerHint, {value: collIncrease})
```

### Hints for `redeemCollateral`

`TroveManager::redeemCollateral` as a special case requires additional hints:
- `_firstRedemptionHint` hints at the position of the first line of credit  that will be redeemed from,
- `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint` hints at the `nextId` neighbor of the last redeemed line of credit  upon reinsertion, if it's partially redeemed,
- `_upperPartialRedemptionHint` hints at the `prevId` neighbor of the last redeemed line of credit  upon reinsertion, if it's partially redeemed,
- `_partialRedemptionHintNICR` ensures that the transaction won't run out of gas if neither `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint` nor `_upperPartialRedemptionHint` are  valid anymore.

`redeemCollateral` will only redeem from lines of credit that have an ICR >= MCR. In other words, if there are lines of credit at the bottom of the SortedTroves list that are below the minimum collateralization ratio (which can happen after an rBTC:USD price drop), they will be skipped. To make this more gas-efficient, the position of the first redeemable line of credit  should be passed as `_firstRedemptionHint`.

#### First redemption hint

The first redemption hint is the address of the line of credit  from which to start the redemption sequence - i.e the address of the first line of credit  in the system with ICR >= 110%.

If when the transaction is confirmed the address is in fact not valid - the system will start from the lowest ICR line of credit  in the system, and step upwards until it finds the first line of credit  with ICR >= 110% to redeem from. In this case, since the number of lines of credit below 110% will be limited due to ongoing liquidations, there's a good chance that the redemption transaction still succeed. 

#### Partial redemption hints

All lines of credit that are fully redeemed from in a redemption sequence are left with zero debt, and are closed. The remaining collateral (the difference between the orginal collateral and the amount used for the redemption) will be claimable by the owner.

It’s likely that the last line of credit  in the redemption sequence would be partially redeemed from - i.e. only some of its debt cancelled with ZSUSD. In this case, it should be reinserted somewhere between top and bottom of the list. The `_lowerPartialRedemptionHint` and `_upperPartialRedemptionHint` hints passed to `redeemCollateral` describe the future neighbors the expected reinsert position.

However, if between the off-chain hint computation and on-chain execution a different transaction changes the state of a line of credit  that would otherwise be hit by the redemption sequence, then the off-chain hint computation could end up totally inaccurate. This could lead to the whole redemption sequence reverting due to out-of-gas error.

To mitigate this, another hint needs to be provided: `_partialRedemptionHintNICR`, the expected nominal ICR of the final partially-redeemed-from line of credit . The on-chain redemption function checks whether, after redemption, the nominal ICR of this line of credit  would equal the nominal ICR hint.

If not, the redemption sequence doesn’t perform the final partial redemption, and terminates early. This ensures that the transaction doesn’t revert, and most of the requested ZSUSD redemption can be fulfilled.

#### Example Redemption with hints
```
 // Get the redemptions hints from the deployed HintHelpers contract
  const redemptionhint = await hintHelpers.getRedemptionHints(ZSUSDAmount, price, 50)

  const { 0: firstRedemptionHint, 1: partialRedemptionNewICR, 2: truncatedZSUSDAmount } = redemptionhint

  // Get the approximate partial redemption hint
  const { hintAddress: approxPartialRedemptionHint } = await contracts.hintHelpers.getApproxHint(partialRedemptionNewICR, numTrials, 42)
  
  /* Use the approximate partial redemption hint to get the exact partial redemption hint from the 
  * deployed SortedTroves contract
  */
  const exactPartialRedemptionHint = (await sortedTroves.findInsertPosition(partialRedemptionNewICR,
    approxPartialRedemptionHint,
    approxPartialRedemptionHint))

  /* Finally, perform the on-chain redemption, passing the truncated ZSUSD amount, the correct hints, and the expected
  * ICR of the final partially redeemed line of credit  in the sequence. 
  */
  await line of credit Manager.redeemCollateral(truncatedZSUSDAmount,
    firstRedemptionHint,
    exactPartialRedemptionHint[0],
    exactPartialRedemptionHint[1],
    partialRedemptionNewICR,
    0, maxFee,
    { from: redeemer },
  )
```

## Gas compensation

In Liquity, we want to maximize liquidation throughput, and ensure that undercollateralized lines of credit are liquidated promptly by “liquidators” - agents who may also hold Stability Pool deposits, and who expect to profit from liquidations.

However, gas costs in RSK are substantial. If the gas costs of our public liquidation functions are too high, this may discourage liquidators from calling them, and leave the system holding too many undercollateralized lines of credit for too long.

The protocol thus directly compensates liquidators for their gas costs, to incentivize prompt liquidations in both normal and extreme periods of high gas prices. Liquidators should be confident that they will at least break even by making liquidation transactions.

Gas compensation is paid in a mix of ZSUSD and rBTC. While the rBTC is taken from the liquidated line of credit , the ZSUSD is provided by the borrower. When a borrower first issues debt, some ZSUSD is reserved as a Liquidation Reserve. A liquidation transaction thus draws rBTC from the line of credit (s) it liquidates, and sends the both the reserved ZSUSD and the compensation in rBTC to the caller, and liquidates the remainder.

When a liquidation transaction liquidates multiple line of credit s, each line of credit  contributes ZSUSD and rBTC towards the total compensation for the transaction.

Gas compensation per liquidated line of credit  is given by the formula:

Gas compensation = `50 ZSUSD + 0.5% of line of credit ’s collateral (rBTC)`

The intentions behind this formula are:
- To ensure that smaller lines of credit are liquidated promptly in normal times, at least
- To ensure that larger lines of credit are liquidated promptly even in extreme high gas price periods. The larger the line of credit , the stronger the incentive to liquidate it.

### Gas compensation schedule

When a borrower opens a line of credit , an additional 20 ZSUSD debt is issued, and 20 ZSUSD is minted and sent to a dedicated contract (`GasPool`) for gas compensation - the "gas pool".

When a borrower closes their active line of credit , this gas compensation is refunded: 20 ZSUSD is burned from the gas pool's balance, and the corresponding 20 ZSUSD debt on the line of credit  is cancelled.

The purpose of the 20 ZSUSD Liquidation Reserve is to provide a minimum level of gas compensation, regardless of the line of credit 's collateral size or the current rBTC price.

### Liquidation

When a line of credit  is liquidated, 0.5% of its collateral is sent to the liquidator, along with the 20 ZSUSD Liquidation Reserve. Thus, a liquidator always receives `{50 ZSUSD + 0.5% collateral}` per line of credit  that they liquidate. The collateral remainder of the line of credit  is then either offset, redistributed or a combination of both, depending on the amount of ZSUSD in the Stability Pool.

### Gas compensation and redemptions

When a line of credit  is redeemed from, the redemption is made only against (debt - 50), not the entire debt.

But if the redemption causes an amount (debt - 50) to be cancelled, the line of credit  is then closed: the 20 ZSUSD Liquidation Reserve is cancelled with its remaining 20 debt. That is, the gas compensation is burned from the gas pool, and the 20 debt is zero’d. The rBTC collateral surplus from the line of credit  remains in the system, to be later claimed by its owner.

### Gas compensation helper functions

Gas compensation functions are found in the parent _LiquityBase.sol_ contract:

`_getCollGasCompensation(uint _entireColl)` returns the amount of rBTC to be drawn from a line of credit 's collateral and sent as gas compensation. 

`_getCompositeDebt(uint _debt)` returns the composite debt (drawn debt + gas compensation) of a line of credit , for the purpose of ICR calculation.

## The Stability Pool

Any ZSUSD holder may deposit ZSUSD to the Stability Pool. It is designed to absorb debt from liquidations, and reward depositors with the liquidated collateral, shared between depositors in proportion to their deposit size.

Since liquidations are expected to occur at an ICR of just below 110%, and even in most extreme cases, still above 100%, a depositor can expect to receive a net gain from most liquidations. When that holds, the dollar value of the rBTC gain from a liquidation exceeds the dollar value of the ZSUSD loss (assuming the price of ZSUSD is $1).  

We define the **collateral surplus** in a liquidation as `$(rBTC) - debt`, where `$(...)` represents the dollar value.

At an ZSUSD price of $1, lines of credit with `ICR > 100%` have a positive collateral surplus.

After one or more liquidations, a deposit will have absorbed ZSUSD losses, and received rBTC gains. The remaining reduced deposit is the **compounded deposit**.

Stability Providers expect a positive ROI on their initial deposit. That is:

`$(rBTC Gain + compounded deposit) > $(initial deposit)`

### Mixed liquidations: offset and redistribution

When a liquidation hits the Stability Pool, it is known as an **offset**: the debt of the line of credit  is offset against the ZSUSD in the Pool. When **x** ZSUSD debt is offset, the debt is cancelled, and **x** ZSUSD in the Pool is burned. When the ZSUSD Stability Pool is greater than the debt of the line of credit , all the line of credit 's debt is cancelled, and all its rBTC is shared between depositors. This is a **pure offset**.

It can happen that the ZSUSD in the Stability Pool is less than the debt of a line of credit . In this case, the the whole Stability Pool will be used to offset a fraction of the line of credit ’s debt, and an equal fraction of the line of credit ’s rBTC collateral will be assigned to Stability Providers. The remainder of the line of credit ’s debt and rBTC gets redistributed to active line of credit s. This is a **mixed offset and redistribution**.

Because the rBTC collateral fraction matches the offset debt fraction, the effective ICR of the collateral and debt that is offset, is equal to the ICR of the line of credit . So, for depositors, the ROI per liquidation depends only on the ICR of the liquidated line of credit .

### Stability Pool deposit losses and rBTC gains - implementation

Deposit functionality is handled by `StabilityPool.sol` (`provideToSP`, `withdrawFromSP`, etc).  StabilityPool also handles the liquidation calculation, and holds the ZSUSD and rBTC balances.

When a liquidation is offset with the Stability Pool, debt from the liquidation is cancelled with an equal amount of ZSUSD in the pool, which is burned. 

Individual deposits absorb the debt from the liquidated line of credit  in proportion to their deposit as a share of total deposits.
 
Similarly the liquidated line of credit ’s rBTC is assigned to depositors in the same proportion.

For example: a liquidation that empties 30% of the Stability Pool will reduce each deposit by 30%, no matter the size of the deposit.

### Stability Pool example

Here’s an example of the Stability Pool absorbing liquidations. The Stability Pool contains 3 depositors, A, B and C, and the rBTC:USD price is 100.

There are two lines of credit to be liquidated, T1 and T2:

|   | line of credit  | Collateral (rBTC) | Debt (ZSUSD) | ICR         | $(rBTC) ($) | Collateral surplus ($) |
|---|-------|------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
|   | T1    | 1.6              | 150         | 1.066666667 | 160        | 10                     |
|   | T2    | 2.45             | 225         | 1.088888889 | 245        | 20                     |

Here are the deposits, before any liquidations occur:

| Depositor | Deposit | Share  |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| A         | 100     | 0.1667 |
| B         | 200     | 0.3333 |
| C         | 300     | 0.5    |
| Total     | 600     | 1      |

Now, the first liquidation T1 is absorbed by the Pool: 150 debt is cancelled with 150 Pool ZSUSD, and its 1.6 rBTC is split between depositors. We see the gains earned by A, B, C, are in proportion to their share of the total ZSUSD in the Stability Pool:

| Deposit | Debt absorbed from T1 | Deposit after | Total rBTC gained | $(deposit + rBTC gain) ($) | Current ROI   |
|---------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| A       | 25                    | 75            | 0.2666666667     | 101.6666667               | 0.01666666667 |
| B       | 50                    | 150           | 0.5333333333     | 203.3333333               | 0.01666666667 |
| C       | 75                    | 225           | 0.8              | 305                       | 0.01666666667 |
| Total   | 150                   | 450           | 1.6              | 610                       | 0.01666666667 |

And now the second liquidation, T2, occurs: 225 debt is cancelled with 225 Pool ZSUSD, and 2.45 rBTC is split between depositors. The accumulated rBTC gain includes all rBTC gain from T1 and T2.

| Depositor | Debt absorbed from T2 | Deposit after | Accumulated rBTC | $(deposit + rBTC gain) ($) | Current ROI |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| A         | 37.5                  | 37.5          | 0.675           | 105                       | 0.05        |
| B         | 75                    | 75            | 1.35            | 210                       | 0.05        |
| C         | 112.5                 | 112.5         | 2.025           | 315                       | 0.05        |
| Total     | 225                   | 225           | 4.05            | 630                       | 0.05        |

It’s clear that:

- Each depositor gets the same ROI from a given liquidation
- Depositors return increases over time, as the deposits absorb liquidations with a positive collateral surplus

Eventually, a deposit can be fully “used up” in absorbing debt, and reduced to 0. This happens whenever a liquidation occurs that empties the Stability Pool. A deposit stops earning rBTC gains when it has been reduced to 0.


### Stability Pool implementation

A depositor obtains their compounded deposits and corresponding rBTC gain in a “pull-based” manner. The system calculates the depositor’s compounded deposit and accumulated rBTC gain when the depositor makes an operation that changes their rBTC deposit.

Depositors deposit ZSUSD via `provideToSP`, and withdraw with `withdrawFromSP`. Their accumulated rBTC gain is paid out every time they make a deposit operation - so rBTC payout is triggered by both deposit withdrawals and top-ups.

### How deposits and rBTC gains are tracked

We use a highly scalable method of tracking deposits and rBTC gains that has O(1) complexity. 

When a liquidation occurs, rather than updating each depositor’s deposit and rBTC gain, we simply update two intermediate variables: a product `P`, and a sum `S`.

A mathematical manipulation allows us to factor out the initial deposit, and accurately track all depositors’ compounded deposits and accumulated rBTC gains over time, as liquidations occur, using just these two variables. When depositors join the Pool, they get a snapshot of `P` and `S`.

The formula for a depositor’s accumulated rBTC gain is derived here:

[Scalable reward distribution for compounding, decreasing stake](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/packages/contracts/mathProofs/Scalable%20Compounding%20Stability%20Pool%20Deposits.pdf)

Each liquidation updates `P` and `S`. After a series of liquidations, a compounded deposit and corresponding rBTC gain can be calculated using the initial deposit, the depositor’s snapshots, and the current values of `P` and `S`.

Any time a depositor updates their deposit (withdrawal, top-up) their rBTC gain is paid out, and they receive new snapshots of `P` and `S`.

This is similar in spirit to the simpler [Scalable Reward Distribution on the RSK Network by Bogdan Batog et al](http://batog.info/papers/scalable-reward-distribution.pdf), however, the mathematics is more involved as we handle a compounding, decreasing stake, and a corresponding rBTC reward.

## ZERO Issuance to Stability Providers

Stability Providers earn ZERO tokens continuously over time, in proportion to the size of their deposit. This is known as “Community Issuance”, and is handled by `CommunityIssuance.sol`.

Upon system deployment and activation, `CommunityIssuance` holds an initial ZERO supply, currently (provisionally) set at 30 million ZERO tokens.

Each Stability Pool deposit is tagged with a front end tag - the RSK address of the front end through which the deposit was made. Stability deposits made directly with the protocol (no front end) are tagged with the zero address.

When a deposit earns ZERO, it is split between the depositor, and the front end through which the deposit was made. Upon registering as a front end, a front end chooses a “kickback rate”: this is the percentage of ZERO earned by a tagged deposit, to allocate to the depositor. Thus, the total ZERO received by a depositor is the total ZERO earned by their deposit, multiplied by `kickbackRate`. The front end takes a cut of `1-kickbackRate` of the ZERO earned by the deposit.

### ZERO Issuance schedule

The overall community issuance schedule for ZERO is sub-linear and monotonic. We currently (provisionally) implement a yearly “halving” schedule, described by the cumulative issuance function:

`supplyCap * (1 - 0.5^t)`

where `t` is year and `supplyCap` is (provisionally) set to represent 32 million ZERO tokens.

It results in the following cumulative issuance schedule for the community ZERO supply:

| Year | Total community ZERO issued |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 0    | 0%                          |
| 1    | 50%                         |
| 2    | 75%                         |
| 3    | 87.5%                       |
| 4    | 93.75%                      |
| 5    | 96.88%                      |

The shape of the ZERO issuance curve is intended to incentivize both early depositors, and long-term deposits.

Although the ZERO issuance curve follows a yearly halving schedule, in practice the `CommunityIssuance` contract use time intervals of one minute, for more fine-grained reward calculations.

### ZERO Issuance implementation

The continuous time-based ZERO issuance is chunked into discrete reward events, that occur at every deposit change (new deposit, top-up, withdrawal), and every liquidation, before other state changes are made.

In a ZERO reward event, the ZERO to be issued is calculated based on time passed since the last reward event, `block.timestamp - lastZEROIssuanceTime`, and the cumulative issuance function.

The ZERO produced in this issuance event is shared between depositors, in proportion to their deposit sizes.

To efficiently and accurately track ZERO gains for depositors and front ends as deposits decrease over time from liquidations, we re-use the [algorithm for rewards from a compounding, decreasing stake](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/packages/contracts/mathProofs/Scalable%20Compounding%20Stability%20Pool%20Deposits.pdf). It is the same algorithm used for the rBTC gain from liquidations.

The same product `P` is used, and a sum `G` is used to track ZERO rewards, and each deposit gets a new snapshot of `P` and `G` when it is updated.

### Handling the front end ZERO gain

As mentioned in [ZERO Issuance to Stability Providers](#zero-issuance-to-stability-providers), in a ZERO reward event generating `ZERO_d` for a deposit `d` made through a front end with kickback rate `k`, the front end receives `(1-k) * ZERO_d` and the depositor receives `k * ZERO_d`.

The front end should earn a cut of ZERO gains for all deposits tagged with its front end.

Thus, we use a virtual stake for the front end, equal to the sum of all its tagged deposits. The front end’s accumulated ZERO gain is calculated in the same way as an individual deposit, using the product `P` and sum `G`.

Also, whenever one of the front end’s depositors tops or withdraws their deposit, the same change is applied to the front-end’s stake.

### ZERO reward events and payouts

When a deposit is changed (top-up, withdrawal):

- A ZERO reward event occurs, and `G` is updated
- Its rBTC and ZERO gains are paid out
- Its tagged front end’s ZERO gains are paid out to that front end
- The deposit is updated, with new snapshots of `P`, `S` and `G`
- The front end’s stake updated, with new snapshots of `P` and `G`

When a liquidation occurs:
- A ZERO reward event occurs, and `G` is updated

## Zero System Fees

Zero generates fee revenue from certain operations. Fees are captured by the ZERO token.

A ZERO holder may stake their ZERO, and earn a share of all system fees, proportional to their share of the total ZERO staked.

Zero generates revenue in two ways: redemptions, and issuance of new ZSUSD tokens.

Redemptions fees are paid in rBTC. Issuance fees (when a user opens a line of credit , or issues more ZSUSD from their existing line of credit ) are paid in ZSUSD.

### Redemption Fee

The redemption fee is taken as a cut of the total rBTC drawn from the system in a redemption. It is based on the current redemption rate.

In the `TroveManager`, `redeemCollateral` calculates the rBTC fee and transfers it to the staking contract, `ZEROStaking.sol`

### Issuance fee

The issuance fee is charged on the ZSUSD drawn by the user and is added to the line of credit 's ZSUSD debt. It is based on the current borrowing rate.

When new ZSUSD are drawn via one of the `BorrowerOperations` functions `openTrove`, `withdrawZSUSD` or `adjustTrove`, an extra amount `ZSUSDFee` is minted, and an equal amount of debt is added to the user’s line of credit . The `ZSUSDFee` is transferred to the staking contract, `ZEROStaking.sol`.

### Fee Schedule

Redemption and issuance fees are based on the `baseRate` state variable in line of credit Manager, which is dynamically updated. The `baseRate` increases with each redemption, and decays according to time passed since the last fee event - i.e. the last redemption or issuance of ZSUSD.

The current fee schedule:

Upon each redemption:
- `baseRate` is decayed based on time passed since the last fee event
- `baseRate` is incremented by an amount proportional to the fraction of the total ZSUSD supply that was redeemed
- The redemption rate is given by `min{REDEMPTION_FEE_FLOOR + baseRate * rBTCdrawn, DECIMAL_PRECISION}`

Upon each debt issuance:
- `baseRate` is decayed based on time passed since the last fee event
- The borrowing rate is given by `min{BORROWING_FEE_FLOOR + baseRate * newDebtIssued, MAX_BORROWING_FEE}`

`REDEMPTION_FEE_FLOOR` and `BORROWING_FEE_FLOOR` are both set to 0.5%, while `MAX_BORROWING_FEE` is 5% and `DECIMAL_PRECISION` is 100%.

### Intuition behind fees

The larger the redemption volume, the greater the fee percentage.

The longer the time delay since the last operation, the more the `baseRate` decreases.

The intent is to throttle large redemptions with higher fees, and to throttle borrowing directly after large redemption volumes. The `baseRate` decay over time ensures that the fee for both borrowers and redeemers will “cool down”, while redemptions volumes are low.

Furthermore, the fees cannot become smaller than 0.5%, which in the case of redemptions protects the redemption facility from being front-run by arbitrageurs that are faster than the price feed. The 5% maximum on the issuance is meant to keep the system (somewhat) attractive for new borrowers even in phases where the monetary is contracting due to redemptions.

### Fee decay Implementation

Time is measured in units of minutes. The `baseRate` decay is based on `block.timestamp - lastFeeOpTime`. If less than a minute has passed since the last fee event, then `lastFeeOpTime` is not updated. This prevents “base rate griefing”: i.e. it prevents an attacker stopping the `baseRate` from decaying by making a series of redemptions or issuing ZSUSD with time intervals of < 1 minute.

The decay parameter is tuned such that the fee changes by a factor of 0.99 per hour, i.e. it loses 1% of its current value per hour. At that rate, after one week, the baseRate decays to 18% of its prior value. The exact decay parameter is subject to change, and will be fine-tuned via economic modelling.

### Staking ZERO and earning fees

ZERO holders may `stake` and `unstake` their ZERO in the `ZEROStaking.sol` contract. 

When a fee event occurs, the fee in ZSUSD or rBTC is sent to the staking contract, and a reward-per-unit-staked sum (`F_rBTC`, or `F_ZSUSD`) is incremented. A ZERO stake earns a share of the fee equal to its share of the total ZERO staked, at the instant the fee occurred.

This staking formula and implementation follows the basic [“Batog” pull-based reward distribution](http://batog.info/papers/scalable-reward-distribution.pdf).


## Redistributions and Corrected Stakes

When a liquidation occurs and the Stability Pool is empty or smaller than the liquidated debt, the redistribution mechanism should distribute the remaining collateral and debt of the liquidated line of credit , to all active lines of credit in the system, in proportion to their collateral.

For two lines of credit A and B with collateral `A.coll > B.coll`, line of credit  A should earn a bigger share of the liquidated collateral and debt.

In Zero it is important that all active lines of credit remain ordered by their ICR. We have proven that redistribution of the liquidated debt and collateral proportional to active line of credit s’ collateral, preserves the ordering of active lines of credit by ICR, as liquidations occur over time.  Please see the [proofs section](https://github.com/liquity/dev/tree/main/packages/contracts/mathProofs).

However, when it comes to implementation, RSK gas costs make it too expensive to loop over all lines of credit and write new data to storage for each one. When a line of credit  receives redistribution rewards, the system does not update the line of credit 's collateral and debt properties - instead, the line of credit ’s rewards remain "pending" until the borrower's next operation.

These “pending rewards” can not be accounted for in future reward calculations in a scalable way.

However: the ICR of a line of credit  is always calculated as the ratio of its total collateral to its total debt. So, a line of credit ’s ICR calculation **does** include all its previous accumulated rewards.

**This causes a problem: redistributions proportional to initial collateral can break line of credit  ordering.**

Consider the case where new line of credit  is created after all active lines of credit have received a redistribution from a liquidation. This “fresh” line of credit  has then experienced fewer rewards than the older line of credit s, and thus, it receives a disproportionate share of subsequent rewards, relative to its total collateral.

The fresh line of credit  would earns rewards based on its **entire** collateral, whereas old lines of credit would earn rewards based only on **some portion** of their collateral - since a part of their collateral is pending, and not included in the line of credit ’s `coll` property.

This can break the ordering of lines of credit by ICR - see the [proofs section](https://github.com/liquity/dev/tree/main/packages/contracts/mathProofs).

### Corrected Stake Solution

We use a corrected stake to account for this discrepancy, and ensure that newer lines of credit earn the same liquidation rewards per unit of total collateral, as do older lines of credit with pending rewards. Thus the corrected stake ensures the sorted list remains ordered by ICR, as liquidation events occur over time.

When a line of credit  is opened, its stake is calculated based on its collateral, and snapshots of the entire system collateral and debt which were taken immediately after the last liquidation.

A line of credit ’s stake is given by:

```
stake = _coll.mul(totalStakesSnapshot).div(totalCollateralSnapshot)
```

It then earns redistribution rewards based on this corrected stake. A newly opened line of credit ’s stake will be less than its raw collateral, if the system contains active lines of credit with pending redistribution rewards when it was made.

Whenever a borrower adjusts their line of credit ’s collateral, their pending rewards are applied, and a fresh corrected stake is computed.

To convince yourself this corrected stake preserves ordering of active lines of credit by ICR, please see the [proofs section](https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/papers).

## Math Proofs

The Zero implementation relies on some important system properties and mathematical derivations.

In particular, we have:

- Proofs that line of credit  ordering is maintained throughout a series of liquidations and new line of credit  openings
- A derivation of a formula and implementation for a highly scalable (O(1) complexity) reward distribution in the Stability Pool, involving compounding and decreasing stakes.

PDFs of these can be found in https://github.com/liquity/dev/blob/main/papers

## Definitions

_**Trove:**_ a collateralized debt position, bound to a single RSK address. Also referred to as a “CDP” in similar protocols.

_**ZSUSD**_:  The stablecoin that may be issued from a user's collateralized debt position and freely transferred/traded to any RSK address. Intended to maintain parity with the US dollar, and can always be redeemed directly with the system: 1 ZSUSD is always exchangeable for $1 USD worth of rBTC.

_**Active line of credit :**_ an RSK address owns an “active line of credit ” if there is a node in the `SortedTroves` list with ID equal to the address, and non-zero collateral is recorded on the line of credit  struct for that address.

_**Closed line of credit :**_ a line of credit  that was once active, but now has zero debt and zero collateral recorded on its struct, and there is no node in the `SortedTroves` list with ID equal to the owning address.

_**Active collateral:**_ the amount of rBTC collateral recorded on a line of credit ’s struct

_**Active debt:**_ the amount of ZSUSD debt recorded on a line of credit ’s struct

_**Entire collateral:**_ the sum of a line of credit ’s active collateral plus its pending collateral rewards accumulated from distributions

_**Entire debt:**_ the sum of a line of credit ’s active debt plus its pending debt rewards accumulated from distributions

_**Individual collateralization ratio (ICR):**_ a line of credit 's ICR is the ratio of the dollar value of its entire collateral at the current rBTC:USD price, to its entire debt

_**Nominal collateralization ratio (nominal ICR, NICR):**_ a line of credit 's nominal ICR is its entire collateral (in rBTC) multiplied by 100e18 and divided by its entire debt.

_**Total active collateral:**_ the sum of active collateral over all line of credit s. Equal to the rBTC in the ActivePool.

_**Total active debt:**_ the sum of active debt over all line of credit s. Equal to the ZSUSD in the ActivePool.

_**Total defaulted collateral:**_ the total rBTC collateral in the DefaultPool

_**Total defaulted debt:**_ the total ZSUSD debt in the DefaultPool

_**Entire system collateral:**_ the sum of the collateral in the ActivePool and DefaultPool

_**Entire system debt:**_ the sum of the debt in the ActivePool and DefaultPool

_**Total collateralization ratio (TCR):**_ the ratio of the dollar value of the entire system collateral at the current rBTC:USD price, to the entire system debt

_**Critical collateralization ratio (CCR):**_ 150%. When the TCR is below the CCR, the system enters Recovery Mode.

_**Borrower:**_ an externally owned account or contract that locks collateral in a line of credit  and issues ZSUSD tokens to their own address. They “borrow” ZSUSD tokens against their rBTC collateral.

_**Depositor:**_ an externally owned account or contract that has assigned ZSUSD tokens to the Stability Pool, in order to earn returns from liquidations, and receive ZERO token issuance.

_**Redemption:**_ the act of swapping ZSUSD tokens with the system, in return for an equivalent value of rBTC. Any account with a ZSUSD token balance may redeem them, whether or not they are a borrower.

When ZSUSD is redeemed for rBTC, the rBTC is always withdrawn from the lowest collateral line of credit s, in ascending order of their collateralization ratio. A redeemer can not selectively target lines of credit with which to swap ZSUSD for rBTC.

_**Repayment:**_ when a borrower sends ZSUSD tokens to their own line of credit , reducing their debt, and increasing their collateralization ratio.

_**Retrieval:**_ when a borrower with an active line of credit  withdraws some or all of their rBTC collateral from their own line of credit , either reducing their collateralization ratio, or closing their line of credit  (if they have zero debt and withdraw all their rBTC)

_**Liquidation:**_ the act of force-closing an undercollateralized line of credit  and redistributing its collateral and debt. When the Stability Pool is sufficiently large, the liquidated debt is offset with the Stability Pool, and the rBTC distributed to depositors. If the liquidated debt can not be offset with the Pool, the system redistributes the liquidated collateral and debt directly to the active lines of credit with >110% collateralization ratio.

Liquidation functionality is permissionless and publically available - anyone may liquidate an undercollateralized line of credit , or batch liquidate lines of credit in ascending order of collateralization ratio.

_**Collateral Surplus**_: The difference between the dollar value of a line of credit 's rBTC collateral, and the dollar value of its ZSUSD debt. In a full liquidation, this is the net gain earned by the recipients of the liquidation.

_**Offset:**_ cancellation of liquidated debt with ZSUSD in the Stability Pool, and assignment of liquidated collateral to Stability Pool depositors, in proportion to their deposit.

_**Redistribution:**_ assignment of liquidated debt and collateral directly to active line of credit s, in proportion to their collateral.

_**Pure offset:**_  when a line of credit 's debt is entirely cancelled with ZSUSD in the Stability Pool, and all of it's liquidated rBTC collateral is assigned to Stability Providers.

_**Mixed offset and redistribution:**_  When the Stability Pool ZSUSD only covers a fraction of the liquidated line of credit 's debt.  This fraction of debt is cancelled with ZSUSD in the Stability Pool, and an equal fraction of the line of credit 's collateral is assigned to depositors. The remaining collateral & debt is redistributed directly to active line of credit s.

_**Gas compensation:**_ A refund, in ZSUSD and rBTC, automatically paid to the caller of a liquidation function, intended to at least cover the gas cost of the transaction. Designed to ensure that liquidators are not dissuaded by potentially high gas costs.

## Development

The Zero monorepo is based on Yarn's [workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) feature. You might be able to install some of the packages individually with npm, but to make all interdependent packages see each other, you'll need to use Yarn.

In addition, some package scripts require Docker to be installed (Docker Desktop on Windows and Mac, Docker Engine on Linux).

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install the following:

- [Git](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) (of course)
- [Node v12.x](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

#### Making node-gyp work

Zero indirectly depends on some packages with native addons. To make sure these can be built, you'll have to take some additional steps. Refer to the subsection of [Installation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) in node-gyp's README that corresponds to your operating system.

Note: you can skip the manual installation of node-gyp itself (`npm install -g node-gyp`), but you will need to install its prerequisites to make sure Zero can be installed.

### Clone & Install

```
git clone https://github.com/liquity/dev.git liquity
cd liquity
yarn
```

### Top-level scripts

There are a number of scripts in the top-level package.json file to ease development, which you can run with yarn.

#### Run all tests

```
yarn test
```

#### Deploy contracts to a testnet

E.g.:

```
yarn deploy --network ropsten
```

Supported networks are currently: rsk testnet, rsk mainnet. The above command will deploy into the default channel (the one that's used by the public dev-frontend). To deploy into the internal channel instead:

```
yarn deploy --network ropsten --channel internal
```

You can optionally specify an explicit gas price too:

```
yarn deploy --network ropsten --gas-price 20
```

After a successful deployment, the addresses of the newly deployed contracts will be written to a version-controlled JSON file under `packages/lib/deployments/default`.

To publish a new deployment, you must execute the above command for all of the following combinations:

| Network | Channel  |
| ------- | -------- |
| rsktestnet | default  |

| rskmainnet   | default  |

At some point in the future, we will make this process automatic. Once you're done deploying to all the networks, execute the following command:

```
yarn save-live-version
```

This copies the contract artifacts to a version controlled area (`packages/lib/live`) then checks that you really did deploy to all the networks. Next you need to commit and push all changed files. The repo's GitHub workflow will then build a new Docker image of the frontend interfacing with the new addresses.

#### Start a local blockchain and deploy the contracts

```
yarn start-dev-chain
```

Starts an RSK node in a Docker container, running the [private development chain](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj), then deploys the contracts to this chain.

You may want to use this before starting the dev-frontend in development mode. To use the newly deployed contracts, switch MetaMask to the built-in "Localhost 8545" network.

> Q: How can I get rBTC on the local blockchain?  
> A: There are some already unlocked accounts 

Once you no longer need the local node, stop it with:

```
yarn stop-dev-chain
```

#### Start dev-frontend in development mode

```
yarn start-dev-frontend
```

This will start dev-frontend in development mode on http://localhost:3000. The app will automatically be reloaded if you change a source file under `packages/dev-frontend`.

If you make changes to a different package under `packages`, it is recommended to rebuild the entire project with `yarn prepare` in the root directory of the repo. This makes sure that a change in one package doesn't break another.

To stop the dev-frontend running in this mode, bring up the terminal in which you've started the command and press Ctrl+C.

#### Start dev-frontend in demo mode

This will automatically start the local blockchain, so you need to make sure that's not already running before you run the following command.

```
yarn start-demo
```

This spawns a modified version of dev-frontend that ignores MetaMask, and directly uses the local blockchain node. Every time the page is reloaded (at http://localhost:3000), a new random account is created with a balance of 100 rBTC. Additionally, transactions are automatically signed, so you no longer need to accept wallet confirmations. This lets you play around with Zero more freely.

When you no longer need the demo mode, press Ctrl+C in the terminal then run:

```
yarn stop-demo
```

#### Build dev-frontend for production

In a freshly cloned & installed monorepo, or if you have only modified code inside the dev-frontend package:

```
yarn build
```

If you have changed something in one or more packages apart from dev-frontend, it's best to use:

```
yarn rebuild
```

This combines the top-level `prepare` and `build` scripts.

You'll find the output in `packages/dev-frontend/build`.

### Configuring your custom frontend

Your custom built frontend can be configured by putting a file named `config.json` inside the same directory as `index.html` built in the previous step. The format of this file is:

```
{
  "frontendTag": "0x2781fD154358b009abf6280db4Ec066FCC6cb435",
  "infuraApiKey": "158b6511a5c74d1ac028a8a2afe8f626"
}
```

## Running a frontend with Docker

The quickest way to get a frontend up and running is to use the [prebuilt image](https://hub.docker.com/r/liquity/dev-frontend) available on Docker Hub.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

### Running with `docker`

```
docker pull liquity/dev-frontend
docker run --name Zero -d --rm -p 3000:80 liquity/dev-frontend
```

This will start serving your frontend using HTTP on port 3000. If everything went well, you should be able to open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. To use a different port, just replace 3000 with your desired port number.

To stop the service:

```
docker kill liquity
```

### Configuring a public frontend

If you're planning to publicly host a frontend, you might need to pass the Docker container some extra configuration in the form of environment variables.

#### FRONTEND_TAG

If you want to receive a share of the ZERO rewards earned by users of your frontend, set this variable to the RSK address you want the ZERO to be sent to.

#### INFURA_API_KEY

This is an optional parameter. If you'd like your frontend to use Infura's [WebSocket endpoint](https://infura.io/docs/RSK#section/Websockets) for receiving blockchain events, set this variable to an Infura Project ID.

### Setting a kickback rate

The kickback rate is the portion of ZERO you pass on to users of your frontend. For example with a kickback rate of 80%, you receive 20% while users get the other 80. Before you can start to receive a share of ZERO rewards, you'll need to set this parameter by making a transaction on-chain.

It is highly recommended that you do this while running a frontend locally, before you start hosting it publicly:

```
docker run --name Zero -d --rm -p 3000:80 \
  -e FRONTEND_TAG=0x2781fD154358b009abf6280db4Ec066FCC6cb435 \
  -e INFURA_API_KEY=158b6511a5c74d1ac028a8a2afe8f626 \
  liquity/dev-frontend
```

Remember to replace the environment variables in the above example. After executing this command, open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser with MetaMask installed, then switch MetaMask to the account whose address you specified as FRONTEND_TAG to begin setting the kickback rate.

### Setting a kickback rate with Gnosis Safe

If you are using Gnosis safe, you have to set the kickback rate mannually through contract interaction. On the dashboard of Gnosis safe, click on "New transaction" and pick "Contraction interaction." Then, follow the [instructions](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/3738081-contract-interactions): 
- First, set the contract address as ```0x66017D22b0f8556afDd19FC67041899Eb65a21bb ```; 
- Second, for method, choose "registerFrontEnd" from the list; 
- Finally, type in the unit256 _Kickbackrate_. The kickback rate should be an integer representing an 18-digit decimal. So for a kickback rate of 99% (0.99), the value is: ```990000000000000000```. The number is 18 digits long.

### Next steps for hosting a frontend

Now that you've set a kickback rate, you'll need to decide how you want to host your frontend. There are way too many options to list here, so these are going to be just a few examples.

#### Example 1: using static website hosting

A frontend doesn't require any database or server-side computation, so the easiest way to host it is to use a service that lets you upload a folder of static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc).

To obtain the files you need to upload, you need to extract them from a frontend Docker container. If you were following the guide for setting a kickback rate and haven't stopped the container yet, then you already have one! Otherwise, you can create it with a command like this (remember to use your own `FRONTEND_TAG` and `INFURA_API_KEY`):

```
docker run --name Zero -d --rm \
  -e FRONTEND_TAG=0x2781fD154358b009abf6280db4Ec066FCC6cb435 \
  -e INFURA_API_KEY=158b6511a5c74d1ac028a8a2afe8f626 \
  liquity/dev-frontend
```

While the container is running, use `docker cp` to extract the frontend's files to a folder of your choosing. For example to extract them to a new folder named "devui" inside the current folder, run:

```
docker cp liquity:/usr/share/nginx/html ./devui
```

Upload the contents of this folder to your chosen hosting service (or serve them using your own infrastructure), and you're set!

#### Example 2: wrapping the frontend container in HTTPS

If you have command line access to a server with Docker installed, hosting a frontend from a Docker container is a viable option.

The frontend Docker container simply serves files using plain HTTP, which is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore it is highly recommended to wrap it in HTTPS using a reverse proxy. You can find an example docker-compose config [here](packages/dev-frontend/docker-compose-example/docker-compose.yml) that secures the frontend using [SWAG (Secure Web Application Gateway)](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag) and uses [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) for automatically updating the frontend image to the latest version on Docker Hub.

Remember to customize both [docker-compose.yml](packages/dev-frontend/docker-compose-example/docker-compose.yml) and the [site config](packages/dev-frontend/docker-compose-example/config/nginx/site-confs/liquity.example.com).
